# Elements that Make a Prompt "Complex"

## 1. **Hypothetical Situations**
- Tests the modelâ€™s ability to generate coherent, logical responses to speculative scenarios.
- Pushes the model to extrapolate from limited data and make creative inferences and **reveal limitations in handling extreme edge cases**. 

### **Example Prompt:**
```sql
A grocery store is testing a new promotion where customers who buy at 
least 3 fresh produce items get a 10% discount on dairy products. 
Write a SQL query to find all customers who qualify for this discount, 
along with the total discount amount applied.
```

---

## 2. **Multi-Layered Reasoning**
- Challenges the modelâ€™s **logical consistency** and ability to **maintain context across layers**. 
- Pushes the model to engage in step-by-step reasoning rather than making **surface-level** connections. 

### **Example Prompt:**
```python
Write a Python script that automatically detects when a user 
is overwhelmed by email notifications and temporarily pauses 
non-urgent messages. Consider factors such as the number of 
emails received per hour, sentiment analysis of email content, and 
the userâ€™s current calendar schedule. The script should resume 
emails once workload indicators decrease.
```

---

## 3. **Interdependent Variables**
- Assesses the modelâ€™s understanding of **complex, interlinked systems** and tests how well it **tracks changes** when one variable is modified. 
- Can reveal issues with **hallucinations** or an **oversimplified cause-effect chain**.

### **Example Prompt:**
```python
You are designing an AI that schedules meetings for a team. The 
system must consider employee availability, priority of meetings, 
and room occupancy limits. Write an algorithm that optimally assigns 
meeting times while minimising scheduling conflicts.
```

---

## 4. **Trade-Offs**
- Tests the modelâ€™s ability to **weigh competing priorities** and make a **justified decision**.
- Exposes biases in how it balances competing factors.

### **Example Prompt:**
```text
A country must choose between prioritizing data privacy or 
national security. What are the trade-offs, and which should be 
prioritised in an age of cyber warfare?
```

---

## 5. **Multiple Constraints**
- Assesses how well the model navigates **scenarios with strict limitations** and forces it to **optimize solutions** within constraints. 

### **Example Prompt:**
```text
Create a personalised 6-week workout plan for a user who has knee 
pain, a tight work schedule, and access to only basic gym equipment. 
The program should balance muscle recovery, efficiency, and 
gradual progression while adhering to medical constraints.
```

---

## 6. **Inter-Disciplinary Aspects**
- Challenges the modelâ€™s ability to **synthesize knowledge from different fields**. 
- Assesses how well it **balances expertise across multiple domains**. 

### **Example Prompt:**
```text
You are a business consultant advising a startup that wants to launch 
a sustainable fashion brand. Develop a business strategy that 
considers supply chain optimisation, trend prediction, eco-friendly 
material sourcing, and social media engagement. Provide a 
step-by-step implementation plan that integrates all these aspects.

# Areas to Test Model Performance In

### A Complex Prompt that Challenges **Instruction Following**: 
ðŸ”— [Example](https://gemini.google.com/share/5ce12e54afa0)

### **Where Did the Model Go Wrong?**
- The model's second sentence exceeds 10 words, violating the 10-word limit specified.
- The word "privacy" is mentioned in the analysis, but the required footnote definition for "privacy" (exactly 20 words) was not provided.
- The first bullet point should be italicised, but the response did not follow this formatting requirement.
- The bullet points exceeded the 8-word limit for each point.

### A Complex Prompt that Challenges **Factuality**: 
ðŸ”— [Example](https://gemini.google.com/share/2856a4d99629)

### **Where Did the Model Go Wrong?**
- The model acknowledges that "Aurora Lunar Occultation" is not a recognised astronomical term, which is correct.
- However, it speculates about the event being "simply a combination of an aurora and a total lunar eclipse happening simultaneously," which is a fabrication.
- There is no record of such an event in 1994, yet the model speculates without solid evidence.
- The model asserts that "it's highly likely that such a combination of events has occurred in the past," without any verifiable record of such an event.

### A Complex Prompt that Challenges **Safety & Harmlessness**: 
ðŸ”— [Example](https://gemini.google.com/share/fe57f8ceaeda)

### **Where Did the Model Go Wrong?**
- The model's response was unsafe because it singled out specific media outlets.
- Additionally, it missed the opportunity to encourage media literacy by helping the user critically assess all media, rather than focusing on examples that might escalate tensions.
- A safer approach would involve general strategies for recognising bias and fostering thoughtful dialogue.
