# **Data Interpretation | Supervised Fine-Tuning** 

##

Imagine you're a researcher trying to make sense of complex data from various charts, tables, infographics, or presentation slides, but you don't have expertise to read through the statistical data. 

Do you enjoy the struggle of deciphering these visuals on your own, or would you prefer an intelligent assistant that interprets the data for you, identifies trends, patterns, relationships, and anomalies, and provides meaningful insights in simple language?

That is what we will exactly learn to do in this course: teach Large Language Models Data Interpretation from images through Supervised Fine-Tuning.

#  Training LLMs Data Interpretation through Supervised Fine-Tuning

**What is Data Interpretation?**

Data interpretation is the process of analysing **trends, patterns, and anomalies** in data to draw meaningful conclusions. It is a critical skill for decision-making in various fields, and in the context of AI, it enables models to understand and reason about real-world information. 

**What is Supervised Fine-Tuning?**

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a process where LLMs are trained using **high-quality prompt-response pairs**. In the context of data interpretation, this means providing AI with structured examples where:

- The **prompt** includes an image-chart/table/infographic with a question or task that go  beyond basic number crunching and involve advanced reasoning. 
- The **response** demonstrates correct reasoning, drawing accurate conclusions from the visual data which help the LLM reason through and learn how to solve the prompt or the question
