##  Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Ever solved a puzzle by breaking it into smaller pieces? That’s exactly how **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** works.  

Instead of jumping straight to the answer, a CoT prompt explicitly asks the model to think through a problem step-by-step before arriving at a final conclusion.  

This makes it perfect for tasks involving reasoning, logic, or multi-step calculations.

> - **Structured Thinking:** Helps the model logically process information.  
> - **Better Accuracy:** Reduces errors in complex tasks by considering each detail.  
> - **Clear Explanations:** Produces more transparent and understandable responses.

### ✅ Steps to Chain-of-Thought Prompting:

1. **Define the problem** – Clearly state the problem for the model.  
2. **Instruct the model to think step-by-step** – Use phrases like *"Let’s think step by step"* or *"Break this down"* to guide the model through the reasoning process.  
3. **Present the solution** – Once the steps are logically followed, ask the model to provide the final answer.
