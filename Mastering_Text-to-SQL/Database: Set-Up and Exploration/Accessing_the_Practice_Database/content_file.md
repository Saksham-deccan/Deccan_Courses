# How Do You Access the Database?

To work effectively with SQL and data, you'll need access to a database. Follow the simple steps below to get started:

1. **Install DBeaver**
   Download and install the DBeaver application on your Windows or Mac system. DBeaver is a powerful tool that will help you easily interact with databases.
2. **Connect to the MySQL Database**
   Connect DBeaver to the MySQL database using the credentials provided below:
   * **Hostname:** `db.relational-data.org`
   * **Port:** `3306`
   * **Username:** `guest`
   * **Password:** `relational`
     Simply enter these details when prompted in DBeaver to establish the connection.
3. **Open the "tpch" Database**
   Once connected, you'll see a list of available databases. Double-click on the `"tpch"` database to access itâ€”this is the database you'll be working with.
