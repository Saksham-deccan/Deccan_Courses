##  Tree-of-Thought Prompting

Imagine brainstorming every possible solution before making a decision. That’s what **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting** helps models do.  

Instead of sticking to one answer, the model generates multiple thought paths, explores different solutions, and backtracks when needed to find the best response.  

With ToT prompting, models become strategic thinkers, exploring creative and logical solutions like a master problem-solver!

> ###  Why Use Tree-of-Thought Prompting?
>
> - **Diverse Solutions** – Models are trained to explore many possibilities, not just one.  
> - **Reduced Errors** – Backtracking allows fixing mistakes along the way.  
> - **Complex Problem Solving** – Ideal for deep reasoning and multi-step decision-making tasks.

### ✅ Steps to Tree-of-Thought Prompting:

1. **Thought Decomposition** – Break the task into smaller parts.  
2. **Thought Generation** – Encourage multiple ideas at each step.  
3. **State Evaluation** – Ask the model to evaluate and refine its choices.
