### <span style="color:#364BC9">1. Clarity & Specificity</span>

* Clarity is one of the most important elements of a good prompt. Keep prompts straightforward and free of jargon.   
* Use action verbs like "list," "explain," or "summarise" to make your request precise.

**Example**:

:::danger
❌  Tell me about technology.
:::

:::info
✅  Summarise the key advancements in AI technology over the past decade.
:::

***

### <span style="color:#364BC9">2. Context</span>

* Context refers to any additional information or background that helps the model understand your question better. 
* If your prompt involves a specific event, scenario, or field, provide the necessary details to guide the model.

**Example:**

:::danger
❌  How can I be more productive at work?
:::

:::info
✅  How can I can increase overall productivity and learning working 9 hour shifts as a  Business Analyst while taking adequate breaks. 
:::

***

### <span style="color:#364BC9">3. Instructional Phrasing</span>

* A good prompt guides the model by explicitly stating what kind of response you expect.
* Use action words like "list," "compare," "explain," "analyse," or "summarise", mention the length or format of your desired response.

**Example:**

:::danger
❌ Write an email to my boss about a meeting. I’ve attached meeting notes.
:::

:::info
✅ Write an email to my boss, summarising the meeting I had with my team this morning about a new project, I have attached the meeting notes. The email should be polite, concise (3-4 sentences), and include a summary of the action points we agreed on. Use a professional tone suitable for a corporate setting.&#x20;
:::

***

### <span style="color:#364BC9">4. Relevance</span>

* Prompts must be closely aligned with the intended outcome and avoid introducing unrelated subjects. 
* If the prompt is too broad, ambiguous, or off-topic, the model may produce irrelevant or unhelpful responses.

**Example:** 

:::danger
❌  Tell me about the electric cars and how they are better and the latest developments in greener public transportation.
:::

:::info
✅  Tell me about the benefits of electric cars, focusing on how they reduce emissions and lower fuel costs compared to gasoline cars. This is for my college research project.
:::

***

### <span style="color:#364BC9">5. Flexibility</span>

* While specificity and clarity are usually crucial, using prompts that let the model explore different angles are beneficial to generate creative or diverse responses. 
* Let the model explore, especially for creative tasks, like story writing or brainstorming.

**Example:** 

:::danger
❌ List 3 renewable energy sources that can be used to reduce carbon emissions. Focus specifically on wind, solar, and hydropower, and explain how each one reduces emissions in urban areas.
:::

:::info
✅ Brainstorm different renewable energy solutions that could help reduce carbon emissions globally. You can include both well-established methods and emerging technologies. Feel free to suggest innovative applications or ideas that might not be widely used yet.
:::

### <span style="color:#364BC9">6. Iteration & Refinement</span>

* Sometimes you won’t get the perfect response on the first try. 
* Iteration and refinement are essential for achieving the best results, especially for more complex or nuanced tasks.&#x20;

By embracing iteration and refinement, you can systematically enhance the quality of responses and optimise for accuracy, clarity, and relevance.
