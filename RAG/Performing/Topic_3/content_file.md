## Framing good questions

A high-quality question is one that includes multiple sub-questions and references information from various sections of the document. When framing such a question, it should be structured like a userâ€™s natural query to an assistant.

A well-crafted question integrates not necessarily all but multiple creative elements from the image below.

<img height = "900" width = "800" src = "${PRIVATE_IMAGE_INTRO_2}" />
Letâ€™s look at our example - UNICEF Annual Report 2023 - and create a good question.

Based on the sections we selected, a good query could be:

*What initiatives have been taken to improve access to education and skill development by UNICEF in 2023? What has been the impact of these initiatives?*

ðŸ’¡**Pro tip**
*Donâ€™t include any kind of reasoning in your query (No calculations, No logical reasoning, No data-driven reasonings) - We are training it to retrieve information not perform any analysis.*

### Simulator/Quiz

Create multiple questions from the document in use as the working example. Create a mix of good questions and poor questions. Learners need to distinguish between them and provide reasoning.
