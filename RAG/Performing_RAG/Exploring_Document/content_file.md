## Explore the document

The first step to create a sample is to have a source of truth, for example, documents, reports, articles. This is to justify the accuracy of our answers.

Grasping the core information within the document is the foundational step (Step 0) for extracting high-quality data points. Here’s how to streamline the process for any document or research paper:

* Begin by identifying all sections in the document that could hold valuable information for the user.
* Group complementary sections to enhance the retrieval process and improve the quality of responses. These pairs can provide a richer context when queried together.

We’ll use the UNICEF Annual Report 2023 as our source of truth.

For this example, we’ll take the important sections to be *‘Part 1 and Part 2’* to understand the major goals and any changes that helped achieve them.
