## Curating well-formatted answers

High-quality answers serve as a gold standard for the model to learn how to synthesize retrieved information with its generative abilities and produce good responses.
Therefore, when creating answers for the data sample, we need to ensure that they are not directly copied from the evidence, but rather paraphrased into a cohesive response.
Some things to keep in mind when curating answers are:

1. **Understand the Core Idea:**<br />Read the evidence carefully to grasp its key message.
2. **Paraphrase Creatively:**<br />Avoid copying phrases directly—focus on conveying the meaning in your own words. Use synonyms, restructured sentences, and simplified explanations to present the same idea in a fresh way.
3. **Add Context:**<br />Where appropriate, connect the core idea of the evidence to broader concepts or user-friendly examples, making the answer engaging and conversational.
4. **Synthesize Multiple Evidences:**<br />Combine insights from different evidences into a cohesive answer. This makes the response more comprehensive and reduces the risk of replicating any one source.
5. **Maintain a Natural Tone:**<br />Write as though you’re explaining the information to a peer. Keep the tone friendly, approachable, and easy to follow.
