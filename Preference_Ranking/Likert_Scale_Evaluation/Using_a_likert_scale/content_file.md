## Likert Scale Ranking System

Once the responses are individually evaluated against the rubrics discussed in the previous sections, they are compared and ranked to identify which one is better. This ranking is done using a **Likert Scale**—a widely accepted industry standard for ranking responses. It helps in converting subjective opinions into quantitative data. A Likert Scale typically consists of a **5- or 7-point rating system**.

### Likert Scale Ranking

Typically, two responses—**Response A** and **Response B**—are ranked using the following scale:

| **1**                       | **2**                  | **3**                           | **4**                          | **5**                           | **6**                  | **7**                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A is **much better** than B | A is **better** than B | A is **slightly better** than B | A and B are **about the same** | B is **slightly better** than A | B is **better** than A | B is **much better** than A |

Similar to well-defined criteria for individual rubrics discussed earlier, **preference ranking** follows a set of objective criteria. The table below explains the ranking nuances in detail.

| **Category**        | **When to Use**                                                                                                  | **Conditions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slightly Better** | Use this when one response is noticeably better than the other, but not by a large margin.                       | - The difference in ratings for the **rubric - ‘Overall Quality’** between the responses should be no more than **1 point**.  - If Response A has a **minor issue** but Response B has a **major issue**, prefer Response A (and vice versa).  - If the responses are **nearly identical** in quality, prefer the **shorter one** (only in rare cases where both are of equal length—use your judgment). |
| **Better**          | Use this when one response is noticeably better than the other.                                                  | - There should be **several (more than 2) minor issues** in either response, impacting the **rubric - ‘Overall Quality’**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Much Better**     | Choose this when there is a **significant quality gap** between the two responses.                               | - A difference of at least **2 points** in the **rubric - ‘Overall Quality’** should be present.  - If one response is **entirely correct** while the other contains **multiple major mistakes**, select the correct one.  - If one response **follows all instructions** while the other does not, prefer the former.                                                                                   |
| **About the Same**  | Use this when both responses are either **very poor** or **very good**, making it difficult to justify a winner. | - Both responses should have a **very low/high ‘Overall Quality’** rubric rating.  - If neither response **correctly follows** the instructions or provides an accurate answer, this should be selected.  - This option is reserved for **extreme cases** where improvement is necessary, rather than a slight preference.                                                                               |
