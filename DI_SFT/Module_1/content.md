## What is Data Interpretation?

Data interpretation is the process of analysing **trends, patterns, and anomalies** in data to draw meaningful conclusions. It is a critical skill for decision-making in various fields, and in the context of AI, it enables models to understand and reason about real-world information. 

## What is Supervised Fine-Tuning?

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a process where LLMs are trained using **high-quality prompt-response pairs**. In the context of data interpretation, this means providing AI with structured examples where:

* The **prompt** includes an image-chart/table/infographic with a question or task that go  beyond basic number crunching and involve advanced reasoning. 
* The **response** demonstrates correct reasoning, drawing accurate conclusions from the visual data which help the LLM reason through and learn how to solve the prompt or the question.
