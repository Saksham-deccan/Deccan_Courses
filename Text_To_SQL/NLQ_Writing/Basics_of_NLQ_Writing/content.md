Crafting effective Natural Language Queries (NLQs) is an art where creativity meets precision. Your goal is to simulate the types of questions real-world users would ask a model. Let’s break down the process step by step to help you write strong, business-focused queries.

## <span style="color:#2E86C1">1. Understand the Database</span>

The foundation of any good NLQ is a deep understanding of the database you're working with. Take time to explore all the tables and columns, running small queries to grasp how the data is structured and how it reflects the business's core functions. This will help you understand the nuances of the data, enabling you to craft more accurate and relevant questions.

## <span style="color:#2E86C1">2. Identify Key Business Metrics</span>

Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the database, the next step is to list the business metrics that someone might be interested in. These metrics should align with the company’s goals.

For example, if the business is an e-commerce seller, focus on key metrics like:

* <span style="color:#D35400">Order delays</span>
* <span style="color:#D35400">Maximum returns</span>
* <span style="color:#D35400">Customer retention rates</span>

Avoid focusing on metrics that don't directly contribute to business insights, such as <span style="color:#E74C3C">"Customer names"</span> or <span style="color:#E74C3C">"Maximum orders"</span> without context.
