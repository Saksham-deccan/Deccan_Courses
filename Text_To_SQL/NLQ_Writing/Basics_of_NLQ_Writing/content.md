# Writing a good quality Natural Language Query (NLQ)

Crafting effective Natural Language Queries (NLQs) is an art where creativity meets precision. Your goal is to simulate the types of questions real-world users would ask a model. Let’s break down the process step by step to help you write strong, business-focused queries.

## 1. Understand the Database

The foundation of any good NLQ is a deep understanding of the database you're working with. Take time to explore all the tables and columns, running small queries to grasp how the data is structured and how it reflects the business's core functions. This will help you understand the nuances of the data, enabling you to craft more accurate and relevant questions.

## 2. Identify Key Business Metrics

Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the database, the next step is to list the business metrics that someone might be interested in. These metrics should align with the company’s goals.  

For example, if the business is an e-commerce seller, focus on key metrics like:

- **Order delays**
- **Maximum returns**
- **Customer retention rates**

Avoid focusing on metrics that don't directly contribute to business insights, such as "Customer names" or "Maximum orders" without context
