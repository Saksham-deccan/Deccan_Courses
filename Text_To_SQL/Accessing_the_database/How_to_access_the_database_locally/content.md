# Getting Started with SQL and DBeaver

To work effectively with SQL and data, you'll need access to a database. Follow the simple steps below to get started:

## 1. Install DBeaver
First, download and install the [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) application on your Windows or Mac system. DBeaver is a powerful tool that will help you easily interact with databases.

## 2. Connect to the MySQL Database
Next, connect DBeaver to the MySQL database using the credentials provided below:

- **Hostname**: `db.relational-data.org`
- **Port**: `3306`
- **Username**: `guest`
- **Password**: `relational`

Simply enter these details when prompted in DBeaver to establish the connection.

## 3. Open the "tpch" Database
Once connected, you'll see a list of available databases. Double-click on the `tpch` database to access itâ€”this is the database you'll be working with.

## 4. Explore the Data
Now that you're in, take a moment to explore the various tables and their data. Familiarizing yourself with the structure and contents of each table will give you a better understanding of how to query and work with the data effectively.
