# Getting Started with SQL and DBeaver

To work effectively with SQL and data, you'll need access to a database. Follow the simple steps below to get started:

## <span style="color:#364BC9">1. Install DBeaver</span>

First, download and install the <a style="color:#364BC9" href="https://dbeaver.io/">DBeaver</a> application on your Windows or Mac system. DBeaver is a powerful tool that will help you easily interact with databases.

## <span style="color:#364BC9">2. Connect to the MySQL Database</span>

Next, connect DBeaver to the MySQL database using the credentials provided below:

<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#364BC9">Hostname</span>: db.relational-data.org</li>
  <li><span style="color:#364BC9">Port</span>: 3306 </li>
  <li><span style="color:#364BC9">Username</span>: guest </li>
  <li><span style="color:#364BC9">Password</span>: relational </li>
</ul>

Simply enter these details when prompted in DBeaver to establish the connection.

## <span style="color:#364BC9">3. Open the "tpch" Database</span>

Once connected, you'll see a list of available databases. Double-click on the `tpch` database to access itâ€”this is the database you'll be working with.

## <span style="color:#364BC9">4. Explore the Data</span>

Now that you're in, take a moment to explore the various tables and their data. Familiarizing yourself with the structure and contents of each table will give you a better understanding of how to query and work with the data effectively.
