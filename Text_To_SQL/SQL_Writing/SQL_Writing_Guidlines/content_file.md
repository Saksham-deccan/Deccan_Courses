# Writing the corresponding SQL query

Now that you’ve crafted your questions, it's time to generate the SQL queries that will extract the relevant information. Writing good SQL queries involves more than just translating the question into SQL—it requires attention to detail and a methodical approach. Let’s break down the key steps to writing quality queries.

- The first and most important step in writing a SQL query is identifying the critical details from the natural language question (NLQ).  

- Many people struggle here—they miss important elements that lead to irrelevant or incomplete queries.  

- To avoid this, make sure to **mark all the essential instructions** that the NLQ is asking for, so nothing is overlooked.

To improve query readability and maintainability, it’s advisable to:

- Use **meaningful aliases** for tables and columns.
- Utilize **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to break down complex logic into simpler, reusable steps.

This ensures that your query remains structured and easier to debug.

An effective query should return **at least one row** in its output.  

If your query returns no data:

- Check your logic.
- Ensure that all conditions are correctly set.
- Verify that your query aligns with the intent of the NLQ.

By following these best practices, you can write **efficient, accurate, and maintainable** SQL queries that properly respond to natural language questions.
